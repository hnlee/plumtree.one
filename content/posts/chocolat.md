Not the film or the book! But rather, a looseleaf flavored black tea that I bought in Montr&eacute;al from Th&eacute;s C.G. six or seven years ago. It was shortly after we had moved to Chicago, and we stayed with Sâ€”, whom I got to meet in person for the first time, despite having known her for almost a decade. Near her apartment, we wandered into a local market where we cobbled together a fantastic meal of bread and p&acirc;t&eacute;. That was also where I bought this tea.

I'm only now getting to the bottom of the canister, and it's definitely well past the "Best before end" date on the container. But it still smells as intensely of chocolate as ever. Like a dark chocolate ganache maybe or a milk chocolate bar that leans on the darker side. It doesn't taste like chocolate at all, despite the cocoa that's been added. Maybe if I tried it with milk?

I know people look down on flavored teas but I rather enjoy them, particularly if the flavor or combination of flavors is unusual.
