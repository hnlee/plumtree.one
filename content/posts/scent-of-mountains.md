A sencha from Shizuoka. I bought a 4 oz bag of looseleaf on strength of the evocative name alone. No regrets.

This tea _is_ refined and delicate but not unapproachable. I like sencha because it is so smooth and, well, _green_, without veering into the slightly rusty taste of some green teas. Is "rusty" the right word? It reminds me of the taste that ê¹€ (laver or nori) gets when stale. A tinge of coppery metal.

[Harney & Sons][harney&sons] mentions a light spinach flavor, which is not an association that comes immediately to mind for me but does make sense if you think of baby spinach leaves, tender and uncooked. Very beautiful, makes you take a pause to appreciate.
